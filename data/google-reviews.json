      "snippet": "We have delayed this statement to allow time for emotions to settle. However we remain extremely dissatisfied with the professionalism, & service provided by the company. At the start, the company’s customer service appeared exemplary, leading us to believe that we would have a positive experience & be in a position to provide a favourable review & recommendation. However, subsequent events significantly altered that perception. On the agreed collection date, the movers arrived in the early evening, contrary to the morning time slot previously promised. Upon arrival, we gave instructions to the driver, on multiple occasions, not to park on the grass due to the risk of the vehicle becoming stuck. These instructions were disregarded, & the driver proceeded to park on the grass, resulting in the vehicle becoming immobilised. My partner was then required to spend approximately 30 minutes assisting in removing the vehicle.The movers did not appear to understand or comply with several instructions.They entered the property wearing muddy footwear, causing significant soiling to the carpets. This required immediate cleaning using our personal carpet cleaner and extended our evening until approximately 11:30 p.m. Furthermore, they demonstrated a lack of care for items clearly labelled as “fragile.” Boxes were thrown into the truck without due regard for the contents. Despite specific verbal instructions to take care with two sets of golf clubs, heavy boxes were placed directly on top of them. This behaviour, combined with the lateness & disregard for handling instructions, caused us considerable concern about the safe delivery of our belongings. While we acknowledge that adverse weather may cause unavoidable delays, the company repeatedly misrepresented the location and delivery schedule of our items over the following days. We were able to verify these misstatements through the use of an Apple AirTag placed within one of our boxes. Rather than providing accurate updates, they appeared to provide information they believed we wished to hear.We received no proactive updates from the company and were required to initiate all follow-up contact ourselves. The delivery ultimately took place on a Sunday evening rather than the Saturday morning originally agreed. Upon arrival, many boxes marked “fragile” were visibly crushed, the legs of our table were bent, and our sofa had sustained a significant rip along its underside. The movers also attempted to deliver a bed and boxes that did not belong to us, which we declined.The most concerning incident occurred following delivery when we raised the matter of the damaged grass at our former property. We requested that the company liaise directly with our former landlord to agree on a resolution, after which we would pay the outstanding balance. During this discussion, the representative—who had previously been courteous—became verbally aggressive, repeatedly shouting over the phone & asserting that the company’s T's&C's rendered them entirely free of liability for any damage caused. He further threatened legal action for non-payment, despite our clear statement that we were not refusing payment but simply seeking rectification of the damage before final settlement.While the movers did eventually return to repair the damaged grass, the company’s conduct strongly suggested an interpretation of their liability clause as granting permission to act without due care or regard for clients’ property. The service received was unsatisfactory in multiple respects: breach of agreed timeframes, disregard for explicit instructions, careless handling of property, and aggressive post-service conduct. In our view, this company failed to exercise reasonable skill, care, and diligence as required under consumer law and contractual obligations. For these reasons, we cannot recommend this company and advise potential clients to proceed with caution.\n\nThey have then proceeded to call & text me threatening legal action over this review although i asked him to stop hassling me.",

Even highly experienced drivers would have faced the same limitation. Unfortunately, the truck became stuck due to the ground conditions.

Some cardboard boxes may have been misshaped during transit, especially in wet conditions, but the contents were protected with bubble wrap. Upon delivery, there were no confirmed reports of broken items from you at the time.\n\nAs this was a shared load service, delivery timing was subject to variables beyond our control, including severe weather and ferry cancellations. These delays were communicated, and while we understand they were frustrating, they were unavoidable. Our team spent an additional day in Wellington due to ferry cancellations, which increased costs to the company but was necessary to complete your delivery.\n\nWith regard to payment, we requested settlement after the delivery was completed and the grass repair had been confirmed.

The guys we used to move out said they would have fit it all into one! Once moved into new place we found damage to most large items of furniture, all though minimal it is still disappointing.
